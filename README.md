# About
This is my base Flask project. 

# Meta

I started this project after leaning things in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aTnmsDMldY, which I found to be pretty unusable once you dig into it. Instead I bought Miguel Grinberg's latest [flask mega tutorial](https://learn.miguelgrinberg.com/) book and am using that as a reference. USD 15, great bargain for what you end up learning. 

Highly recommended.
